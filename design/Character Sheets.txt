Combined Abilities:


Rage+Anxiety: Combination becomes invincible for a short period and can destroy stronger obstacles and enemies. Also runs faster than normal Rage


Rage+Depression: Cries magma tears that harden after some time to form a path


Depression+Anxiety: Can shoot frozen tears in a controllable direction 360° to hit far away enemies/mechanisms/etc…


Rage+Anxiety+Depression: Creates a gigantic explosion that can clear any obstacle, but scatters all characters without being able to control them. Player needs to plan so that they can meet on their own/ reach the exit after having used this ability.


Observation:
Possible Abilities with 3 Characters: 3 Individual + 3*2nd tier + 1*3rd tier = 7 Abilities
Possible Abilities with 4 Characters: 4 Individual + 6*2nd tier + 4*3rd tier + 1*4th tier = 15 Abilities


=> 3 Characters seem more manageable (Plus emotions stay more varied)


Questions:
Should character's "melt together" shortly for combined abilities? (Artist's opinion important)
