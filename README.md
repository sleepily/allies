Negative emotions only hold us back...that's what most people think. But that changes once they combine! In this game, the 3 major negative emotions Rage, Depression and Anxiety are on a journey through a fierce and unforgiving labyrinth of puzzles. While they would be hopelessly lost alone as they would run wild, together, they can strengthen each other and find a way to the end. So, please, forget me notâ€¦

## concept
The player navigates the 3 characters through increasingly difficult and complex levels and has to get all of them to the exit. To do this, he can use basic movement abilities (walking and jumping) and character-specific abilities. Furthermore, these abilities can be combined if two characters stand close enough together, allowing for a lot of creative thinking.
