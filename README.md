## setting up github desktop
0. **important:** first of all, you don't explicitly *need* to do this. you can also upload your stuff by navigating into the correct folder in your web browser and dragging your files into your browser window, but if you want to be able to access all (updated!) files at any time, be sure to set up the github desktop client.
1. download the github desktop client from here: https://desktop.github.com/

2. after logging into github desktop, go to file > clone repository:

3. this repo should then show up in the window (if it doesn't, go to 'URL' and paste in https://github.com/sleepily/allies.git). select a local folder you want to use and click 'clone':

4. select the 'wip' branch in github desktop:

5. and click on 'fetch origin'. this will download all the files to your local folder:

## committing and pushing
0. every time someone else has changed something, you should fetch the repo again. as artists, this doesn't matter than much since each of you can work on seperate things. if you want to work on each other's files, please communicate when you can update your local files so nobody is working on outdated files.

1. now, you can change/add your local files and github will keep track of what you've changed.
when you're done with changing/adding the things you needed to do, you need to commit the changes (see below).
when making a commit, please add a description of what you've changed so we can easily backtrack changes and errors:

2. once you've finished your commit, you can keep working on the next commit, but you should push (upload) your work as soon as possible, so everybody else can access it:

i will keep track of the commits and test them. if everything is working smoothly, i will merge the wip branch into the master (think about it like the 'stable' version).
that's pretty much it.
